       <h3>What is the benefit of Royal Caribbean's online check-in process?</h3> 
            <p class="answer">
           Completing the Online Check-In process for all the guests in your reservation will save you from having to fill out forms at the pier and needs to be completed 3 days prior to your saildate.
            Royal Caribbean International requires guests to be checked in no later than 60 minutes prior to the scheduled sailing time*. Guests arriving late will not be permitted to sail. This supports government regulations in some ports that require cruise lines to submit a departure manifest 60 minutes prior to sailing. Guests are requested to complete Online Check-In no later than 3 days prior to the cruise in order to expedite the pier check-in process. 
            *Some sailings may require an earlier check-in time. Please refer to your Guest Vacation Documents for specific information. 
            Once you have completed the Online Check-In process, you will receive a SetSail Pass. It indicates that you successfully completed the check-in process for you and those guests listed on your SetSail Pass.
            Please manage your reservation and fill out the required fields to start your check-in process.
