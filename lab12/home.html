            <p>some words!!!!!!!!! lotsa pizza words</p>
                <p>Two British mathematicians have added to the discussion about inequality by applying the concept to a pizza pie.  The two researchers, Joel Anthony Haddley and Stephen Worsley attempted to seek for a perfectly equal and fair way to divide a margherita pizza, and what they found is that it is, in fact, extremely difficult (if not impossible) to do so.

                    The paper, titled Infinite Familes of Monohedral Disk Tilings, reminds us that since pizza pies are curved, there is always a chance of inequality (even grossly so) when cutting up slices.  But the researchers found that there is in fact a way to cut a pizza so as to achieve mathematical equality.  It has to do with cutting the pizza into what are known as “monohedral disk tiles”, or curved slices with a very specific shape. </p>
