                <li>The purpose of a !DOCTYPE is to instruct the browser about which version of HTML the webpage is.</li> 
                <li>There will be bugs in the webpage because the browser won't know which version of HTML you're using, so it will default to an old version.</li>
                <li>If you had two HTML elements as siblings, nothing changes on the physical webpage, but the coding is confusing. </li>
                <li>Currently, our browser tab says 127.0.0.1 </li>
                <li>The browser handled the new body text by putting at the beginning of our answers.</li>
                <li>The higher the number of the header, the smaller the text is, so subheads are smaller than their preceding headers.</li>
                <li>Nothing happened when we put the ol tag in.</li>
                <li>A grocery list and a class roster</li>
